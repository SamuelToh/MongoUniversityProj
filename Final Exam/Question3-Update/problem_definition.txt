nron Introductions\n\n\nHello Andy.\n\nIt's been a long time since we talked, but I trust that things are well with\nyou
 and Lea.\n\nThe reason for my email is that my business partners Sunil Hirani and Dik\nBlewitt are going to be in Houst
on visiting with Ken Lay at 10:30 A.M. on\nWednesday.  I think that you would find their business (trading credit risk)\
nto be of interest, and I know they would like to meet you.\n\nWould you have any time on your calendar for lunch or for
 an introduction\nduring the afternoon?\n\nBriefly,  Sunil is the co-founder of creditex, a the credit derivatives\ntrad
ing platform that the market has adopted as the e-market for credit\nderivatives.  Dik is Chief Strategic Officer of cre
ditex.\n\nMy relationship with Dik and Sunil comes from our shared interest in trading\nsyndicated loans.  creditex and
I have co-founded LoanX, Inc., to do for the\nloan market what creditex has done for the credit derivatives market.\n\nS
orry for the out-of-the blue email, but I look forward to catching up with\nyou in the future.\n\nI've copied Sunil and
Dik to facilitate any schedule coordination that might\nbe possible.\n\nMy best to Lea.\n\nMike\nmichael.rushmore@loanx.
