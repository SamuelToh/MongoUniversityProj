2) Remove all indexes from the collection, leaving only the index on _id in place

Why?
This is so that restructuring of indexes will not need to consider during insert. Probably recompile
the index when all inserts are done.

4) Set w=0, j=0 on writes

Why?
This is so that the program doesn't wait for the acknowledgement of write from the primary mongo instance.
And it also doesn't care whether the journal has been updated or not. Thus increasing insert performance,
however you run the danger of data lost on situation when the primary instance goes down.
