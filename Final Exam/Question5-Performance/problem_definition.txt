Given the following indexes.

FINAL: QUESTION 5

Suppose your have a collection stuff which has the _id index,

  {
    "v" : 1,
    "key" : {
      "_id" : 1
    },
    "ns" : "test.stuff",
    "name" : "_id_"
  }
and one or more of the following indexes as well:

  {
    "v" : 1,
    "key" : {
      "a" : 1,
      "b" : 1
    },
    "ns" : "test.stuff",
    "name" : "a_1_b_1"
  }
  {
    "v" : 1,
    "key" : {
      "a" : 1,
      "c" : 1
    },
    "ns" : "test.stuff",
    "name" : "a_1_c_1"
  }
  {
    "v" : 1,
    "key" : {
      "c" : 1
    },
    "ns" : "test.stuff",
    "name" : "c_1"
  }
  {
    "v" : 1,
    "key" : {
      "a" : 1,
      "b" : 1,
      "c" : -1
    },
    "ns" : "test.stuff",
    "name" : "a_1_b_1_c_-1"
  }



Suppose you run the following query against the collection.

db.stuff.find({'a':{'$lt':10000}, 'b':{'$gt': 5000}}, {'a':1, 'c':1}).sort({'c':-1})
Which of the indexes could be used by MongoDB to assist in answering the query? Check all that apply.


1) _id_
2) a_1_c_1
3) a_1_b_1
4) a_1_b_1_c_-1
5) c_1
